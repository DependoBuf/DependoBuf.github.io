# Introduction

DependoBuf is a novel structured data serialization format that incorporates
dependent types into the data model. It is designed to be a more expressive and
safe alternative by providing the ability to describe not only the structure of
the data, but the relationships between the data as well and enforcing those
relationships at both compile and runtime.

Consider transmission of binary tree as example.
=== "Protocol Buffers"

    <div class="grid" markdown>
    <div markdown>
    ```protobuf
    message TreeH {
        message TreeHLeaf {
            int32 value = 1;
            uint32 height = 2;
        }

        message TreeHNode {
            int32 value = 1;
            uint32 height = 2;
            TreeH left = 3;
            TreeH right = 4;
        }

        oneof treeh_type {
            TreeHLeaf leaf = 1;
            TreeHNode node = 2;
        }
    }
    ```

    :heavy_multiplication_x: No way to define constraints in schema

    :heavy_multiplication_x: No way to validate constraints soundness

=== "DependoBuf"

    <div class="grid" markdown>
    <div markdown>
    ```dbuf
    enum TreeH (height Unsigned) {
        0 => {
            TreeHLeaf {
                value Int
            }
        }
        * => {
            TreeHNode {
                value Int
                left TreeH (height - 1)
                right TreeH (height - 1)
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    !!! warning
        Names of builtin types are not fixed, so the code
        might be incorrect.

    :heavy_check_mark: Constraint definition in schema

    :heavy_check_mark: Soundness validation at compile time

    :heavy_check_mark: Automatic validation of constraints at runtime
